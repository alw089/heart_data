We utilized the Heart Disease dataset to follow our analysis of how the variables provided leads to increased likelihood of obtaining heart disease. 
The dataset background is as follows:

## Dataset Background
The Heart Failure Prediction Dataset is a conglomerate dataset of independent pre-existing datasets. The datasets were combined over their 11 common features. The sources of the conglomerate datasets that capture the data are:
Cleveland: 303 Observations
Hungarian: 294 Observations
Switzerland: 123 Observations
Long Beach VA: 200 Observations
Stalog Heart Data Set: 270 Observations
The final dataset had 918 observations (272 observations were repeated from the 1190 total observations) as well as 12 attributes

The 12 attributes include the following
Age:int, ranging from 28-77
Sex:char,[M: Male, F: Female]
Chest Pain Type:string, 4 Types
Typical Angina
Atypical Angina
Non-Anginal Pain
Asymptomatic
Resting Blood Pressure: int ranging from 80-200
Cholesterol: int ranging from 0-400
Fasting Blood Sugar:bool, 1: if FastingBS > 120, 0: if otherwise
Resting ECG: string, resting ECG results: Normal, LVH, ST
Max Heart Rate:int ranging between 60-202
Exercise Angina: exercise-induced Angina [Y: Yes, N: No]
Oldpeak: int, ranging between -2.6-6.2
ST_Slope: The slope of the peak exercise ST segment
Up: upsloping
Flat: flat slope
Down: Downsloping
Heart Disease: output class [1: heart disease positive, 0: Normal heart]
